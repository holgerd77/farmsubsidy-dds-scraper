Server Setup

Deployment of all server parts is done on an ``Ubuntu 14.04`` ``AWS/EC2`` instance, Python ``fabric``
is used for deployment automation, fabric files can be found in ``openfarmsubsidies-scraper`` repository.

The following fabric tasks are just for orientation what need to be installed/done
and are not intended to pass through, depending on your system pre-requisites::

  fab prepare_system
  fab install_deps

Script templates for setting up ``Gunicorn``, ``Nginx`` and ``Supervisor`` can be
found in the ``conf`` folder.

``SSL`` cert is created with **Let's Encrypt** with the following command::

  sudo /home/ubuntu/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt certonly -d openfarmsubsidies.org -d www.openfarmsubsidies.org -d scraper.openfarmsubsidies.org -d api.openfarmsubsidies.org
